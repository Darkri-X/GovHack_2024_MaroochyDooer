# Moreton Bay Greening as We Grow (QLD)
## Moreton Bay Council
How might we harness the power of the everyday citizen to help protect our diverse flora and fauna as we grow our region, creating a diverse and flourishing planet for generations to come?
## Project
Using Open Data from a variety of sources, help us create a sustainable future and protect our local flora and fauna. Ideas and examples could include:  

- Improving our communities recycling awareness, identification, and classification of what can and can’t be recycled
- Managing and protecting our biodiversity from invasive species
- Circular economy solutions
- Urban heat island effects
- Tracking and monitoring the health of our local Koalas and platypi
- Climate change mitigation strategies
- All ideas welcome, and remember to focus on our Moreton Bay region!

This Moreton Bay challenge was put together by a consortium of business, education and government organisations, all passionate about our local region. We will have a group of university students and local business leaders participating on campus at UniSC Moreton Bay alongside local innovators, and we encourage you to join with them in putting a spotlight on our region.

We are looking for innovative ideas to use our data to promote a sustainable future for the City of Moreton Bay. We are looking for a snappy pitch, an innovative approach and a working prototype of the solution. The challenge has been kept broad in nature to harness and unlock your creative ideas.

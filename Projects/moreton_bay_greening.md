# Moreton Bay Greening as We Grow (QLD)
## Moreton Bay Council
How might we harness the power of the everyday citizen to help protect our diverse flora and fauna as we grow our region, creating a diverse and flourishing planet for generations to come?
## Project
Using Open Data from a variety of sources, help us create a sustainable future and protect our local flora and fauna. Ideas and examples could include:  

- Improving our communities recycling awareness, identification, and classification of what can and can’t be recycled
- Managing and protecting our biodiversity from invasive species
- Circular economy solutions
- Urban heat island effects
- Tracking and monitoring the health of our local Koalas and platypi
- Climate change mitigation strategies
- All ideas welcome, and remember to focus on our Moreton Bay region!

This Moreton Bay challenge was put together by a consortium of business, education and government organisations, all passionate about our local region. We will have a group of university students and local business leaders participating on campus at UniSC Moreton Bay alongside local innovators, and we encourage you to join with them in putting a spotlight on our region.

We are looking for innovative ideas to use our data to promote a sustainable future for the City of Moreton Bay. We are looking for a snappy pitch, an innovative approach and a working prototype of the solution. The challenge has been kept broad in nature to harness and unlock your creative ideas.

1. Council has a broad range of open datasets available that can be found on our datahub [https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/)
2. Council has a number of climate sensors around the region, along with flood and rainfall sensors. Please take time to look through the available IOT devices. [https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/)
3. Council has data sets on our waste facility locations and has significant supplementary material on our website. Check out the waste education section on recycling for ideas
4. Council also has additional data and reports for supplementary material on the council website [https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/](https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/)

FYI BOM has a weather station at Redcliffe which can be accessed for free via BOM.gov.au ([http://reg.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDQ60901/IDQ60901.95591.json](http://reg.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDQ60901/IDQ60901.95591.json)  
Council also provides BOM flood warning station data for those it operates. [http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/flood/networks/owner_listing.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/flood/networks/owner_listing.shtml). This provides the latest river heights for various locations across the council. [http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/wrap_fwo.pl?IDQ60286.html#Pine/Caboolture](http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/wrap_fwo.pl?IDQ60286.html#Pine/Caboolture)

These dataset links are provided below as well.

**Eligibility:** Open to everyone, preference will be given to those providing solutions using at least one local Moreton Bay region (City of Moreton Bay) data set. . Employees of City of Moreton Bay with a direct working relationship with members of the local Moreton Bay Gov Hack node organising committee are ineligible to apply for this prize. If unsure, please feel welcome to check and discuss via Slack channels upon commencement of the event.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

## Project breakdown
Here are some innovative ideas using open data to promote a sustainable future in the Moreton Bay region, with a focus on recycling, biodiversity, and climate change:

### 1. **Recycling Optimization Platform**

- **Idea:** Develop a mobile app that uses image recognition AI to help residents identify recyclable materials, reducing contamination in recycling bins. The app could provide information on the nearest recycling facilities based on user location and the type of recyclable.
- **Data Used:** Utilize the council’s waste facility locations and recycling education materials.
- **Impact:** Enhances recycling rates and educates the community on proper recycling practices.

### 2. **Biodiversity Protection System**

- **Idea:** Create an AI-driven monitoring system that uses IoT devices to detect the presence of invasive species in real-time. This system could trigger alerts to local conservation groups for rapid response.
- **Data Used:** Leverage biodiversity data sets and IoT sensor data from the region.
- **Impact:** Protects native species by managing and mitigating the impact of invasive species.

### 3. **Circular Economy Marketplace**

- **Idea:** Develop an online platform that connects businesses and consumers for the purpose of exchanging waste materials that can be reused or repurposed, promoting a circular economy.
- **Data Used:** Use business registry and waste data to identify potential sources and needs for waste materials.
- **Impact:** Reduces waste and promotes sustainability by facilitating the reuse of materials.

### 4. **Urban Heat Island Mitigation Tool**

- **Idea:** Utilize GIS and climate sensor data to map urban heat islands in Moreton Bay. Develop strategies to increase green spaces or alter building materials in these areas.
- **Data Used:** Climate sensor data and urban planning data.
- **Impact:** Reduces urban temperatures and improves living conditions in heat-affected areas.

### 5. **Koala and Platypus Health Tracker**

- **Idea:** Implement a tracking system that uses satellite and drone imagery to monitor the health and population of local koalas and platypi, alerting authorities to any significant changes or threats.
- **Data Used:** Environmental data and reports from local wildlife organizations.
- **Impact:** Enhances the conservation efforts and helps in the recovery of these species by providing accurate data on their population dynamics.

### 6. **Climate Change Impact Visualizer**

- **Idea:** Build an interactive online tool that models potential future climate scenarios based on historical weather data and current climate trends. This tool can help in planning mitigation strategies.
- **Data Used:** Historical weather data from BOM and current climate sensor data.
- **Impact:** Assists local government and residents in understanding potential impacts of climate change and facilitates better preparation.

These ideas not only utilize local data effectively but also engage the community and stakeholders in sustainable practices, promoting environmental conservation and informed decision-making in the Moreton Bay region.
